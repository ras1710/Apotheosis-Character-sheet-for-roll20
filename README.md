# Apotheosis-Character-sheet-for-roll20
Building upon a template provided by roll20 to make a functional low calculation character sheet for the apotheosis ttrpg system

To add this to your roll20 games, first set the sheet used to custom and then get the contents of both the html and the css.
Go into your game and select game settings.
Scroll to the bottom of the page.
In the window that reads html layout copy and paste the contents of the html file.
then select the tab that says css styling
copy and paste the contents of the css file
save your changes
if all went well you will have added this sheet to your roll20 games.

if extra help is needed or you want to suggest a change, I can be reached on discord. Rob#6873
